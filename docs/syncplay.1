.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B syncplay
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBsyncplay\fP is a program that allows you to watch movies with friends or
family at different places synchronized via the internet.

When a viewer pauses/continues playback or seeks within their media player this
will be replicated across all media players connected to the same server in the
same viewing session. A chat function is included so viewers can discuss the
movie while watching it. To improve the communication experience for viewers,
the Syncplay developers and this package suggest to use additional VoIP
(package mumble) or video phone (package jami) software.

Technically, it synchronizes the position and play states of multiple mpv, VLC,
MPC-HC and MPC-BEmedia player instances so viewers' players present the same
movie at the same time.

There are known synchronization issues with VLC. If you experience such problems
use MPV instead.
